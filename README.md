# **John Hammond "envy" script**

****

These codes from John Hammond in this video:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJlqQYyzGi8?si=wcwbCkU1CVxr9GGW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I think this script is very interesting and smart(better than me a lot).

So... I take snapshots in this video frames by frames and code down.

Thank you again, JH. I have learned a lot from you.
